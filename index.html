<h4>Recent Projects</h4>

<div class="project">
  <h5>Usage Statistics - RecoveryLibrary.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    For Pat Deegan PhD &amp; Associates, my most signficant contribution was a system for their
    customers&mdash;mental health clinics&mdash;for gaining insight into how the 
    members of their organizations are using and benefiting from the RecoveryLibrary
    product via collection, aggregation, and graphing various statistical data. This was a critical component 
    of the offering as it will be used by these clinics to demonstrate its value 
    to their funding sources. Additionally, PDA will use it internally to hone their product.

<div class="project">
  <h5>Draft Scoring - RotoDraft.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    For Impact Fantasy Sports, I was solely responsible for developing one of their
    most important features, the scoring of drafts. Due to the complexity and processing
    required, their offering is previously unattempted in the fantasy sports market.
    As such, considerable planning and testing was required to ensure fault tolerance, 
    scalability, and throughput.

<div class="project">
  <h5>Product Catalog - CustomInk.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    Rewrote CustomInk's Product Management System to be more flexible and
    usable. The legacy system had an inflexible schema and a very tedious
    interface. Numerous UX improvements were made over the old system
    resulting in a more intuitive and faster UI which enabled the Products Team
    to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to add new products. One
    of the more challenging aspects of this project was the requirement to
    maintain parity with the data in the legacy schema to allow for many integration
    points to be migrated piecemeal to the new API.

<div class="project">
  <h5>T-Shirt Printer Rolodex - CustomInk.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    Previously, employees tasked with finding a viable printer to fulfill a
    customer's order had to manually search through an 80 page Excel workbook.
    This data was structured and given a CRUD interface including another UI to replace
    the workbook. These employees are now able to search for printers via
    certain attributes rather than visually scanning spreadsheets resulting
    in gains in efficiency and correctness. This project is a core service of
    the system that has allowed CustomInk to automate the majority of its orders.

<div class="project">
  <h5>Payment Routing Service - CustomInk.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    This service was created to DRY up redundant code for financial transactions
    into a single system and abstract away vendor specific payment processing
    idiosyncrasies. My responsibilities involved integrating SecureNet
    by developing a new gateway for use in ActiveMerchant and
    adding ACH capabilities for Payflow. The system was also capable of
    throttling transactions to multiple gateways by setting percentage
    thresholds per gateway.

<div class="project">
  <h5>Order Fulfillment System - CustomInk.com</h5>
  <p class="description">
    My contributions to this project were numerous. I rewrote the system used
    for ordering blank products from CustomInk's many suppliers which
    resulted in fewer errors and increased productivity. This large project that
    makes heavy use of AJAX often had significant performance problems.
    Through profiling and utilization of techniques like multi-threading I/O operations,
    SQL optimization, and preemptively caching expensive requests,
    I was able to save several man hours per day.
