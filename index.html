  <p class="description">
    Rewrote CustomInk's Product Management System to be more flexible and
    usable. The legacy system had an inflexible schema and a very tedious
    interface. MongoDB was chosen for its flexible data modeling capabilities
    and its speed. Numerous UX improvements were made over the old system
    resulting in a more intuitive and faster UI which enabled the Products Team
    to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to add new products. One
    of the more challenging aspects of this project was the requirement to
    maintain parity with the data in the legacy schema.

    Previously, employees tasked with finding a viable printer to fulfill a
    customer's order had to manually search through an 80 page Excel workbook.
    This data was structured and given a CRUD interface including another UI to replace
    the workbook. These employees are now able to search for printers via
    certain attributes rather than visually scanning spreadsheets resulting
    in gains in efficiency and correctness. Work is currently underway using
    this resource to automate printer selection. Again, MongoDB was chosen for
    its flexible data modeling.

  <p class="description">
    This service was created to DRY up redundant code for financial transactions
    into a single system and abstract away vendor specific payment processing
    idiosyncrasies. My responsibilities involved integrating SecureNet
    by developing a new gateway for use in ActiveMerchant and
    adding ACH capabilities for Payflow. The system was also capable of
    throttling transactions to multiple gateways by setting percentage
    thresholds per gateway.

    My contributions to this project were numerous. I rewrote the system used
    for ordering blank products from CustomInk's numerous suppliers which
    resulted in fewer errors and increased productivity. This large project that
    makes heavy use of AJAX often had significant performance problems.
    Through profiling and utilization of techniques like multi-threading I/O operations,
    SQL optimization, and preemptively caching expensive requests,
    I've been able to save several man hours per day.
